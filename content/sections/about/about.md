Hi, my nickname is Putu, someone who was born on March 5, 1997 in Mataram, NTB.

I am graduate from Brawijaya University majoring in Electrical Engineering who has an interest in the internet, technology, networks, automation, and coding. I like to learn new things, especially in technology and automation.

I've been studying frontend and backend developers self-taught since 2016. Starting from only using the native PHP programming language until now using NodeJs, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NextJs, Golang etc.
